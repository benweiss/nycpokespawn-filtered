# @nycpokespawn, filtered

This program is designed to give you a filtered view of the [@nycpokespawn](https://twitter.com/nycpokespawn) Twitter account. It **filters by Pok√©mon** (so you can avoid getting notified about ones you already have) **and by distance to a set of locations** (so you can be notified only about Pok√©mon that spawn near locations you usually hang out at).

## Setup

- Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json`.
- Add your Twitter API credentials:
  - [Generate a Twitter token](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens) for your account.
  - You'll probably need to create a new application while doing so.
  - Use the generated data to fill in the appropriate fields in `config.json`.
- Add your Twilio API credentials:
  - [Sign up for an account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
  - Use the resulting page to fill in the appropriate fields in `config.json`.
  - Go to the SMS section and click "Get your first Twilio number", and fill that field in as well.
  - FYI, if you don't pay Twilio, it will prepend "Sent from your Twilio trial account - " to all your messages.
- Set the phone number to text in `config.json`'s `numberToText` field.
- Update the locations with whatever locations and radiuses you want to monitor. Radiuses are in kilometers.
  - [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_walking_speed), average human walking speed is 5.0 km/h with fast walking "upwards of" 9.0 km/h.
  - So let's say you run at 12 km/h since you're really motivated to catch Pok√©mon. That's 0.2 km/min.
  - Maybe you'll get 15 minutes warning in the best case, so a conservative radius that shouldn't miss many pokes is 3 km.
- Pare down the list of Pok√©mon you want to search for based on your Pok√©dex.
  - Note that @nycpokespawn does not Tweet all the Pok√©mon üòï. So some of the Pok√©mon in the list will likely never matter.

## Testing

You can test the program by running

```
node scripts/run-on-test-data.js
```

which will use the test data stored in `test/fixtures/tweets.json` to run through the normal program, log what's going on, and text you if appropriate. This can be used to ensure you did the setup correctly.

## Running

Just do

```
node bin/daemon.js
```

to start the program. It will run forever, logging output for your information, and texting when appropriate.

You could leave this running on your computer, if it doesn't turn off often, or maybe you could get a cloud provider. I haven't looked into that yet, but [now](https://zeit.co/now/) is really nice and easy to use, although you have to pay to keep things secret (like your API credentials).

## Future Possibilities

- If you have overlapping zones, only text about one of them
- Add walking or cab times to the messages
- Add a simple web UI that would allow you to update the locations list on the go (so e.g. if you're spending a day in Central Park you can add it from your phone)
- Re-do the project to be based on direct Pok√©mon Go API access, using hundreds of accounts spread throughout the city, instead of using the @nycpokespawn Twitter stream
  - This would allow us to get notified about Pok√©mon that @nycpokespawn doesn't care about, such as Lickitung or Magmar
  - [This Node.js chatbot code](https://github.com/hlfshell/pokemon-go-slackbot/blob/master/chatbot.js) looks fairly simple
  - And with [PTC-Creator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/PTC-Creator) we can create hundreds of accounts fairly easily
